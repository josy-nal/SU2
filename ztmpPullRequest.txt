The present work is on the modifications to the actuator disk model.
Variable load actuator disk (VLAD) [Saetta, 2020]
uses the given blade loading to impose
axial and tangential jumps at the interface. Propeller loading is
susceptible to different parameters. Also, blade loading is affected with
the surrounding structures and angle of attack (AoA).
A method that updates the blade loading
at run time is required to take care of the interactions and installation
effects. Blade element method (BEM) is coupled to the SU2 solver to
calculate the blade loading recursively. Propeller geometry details,
airfoil characteristics, propeller speed and set blade angle are required.
Using the thrust and power along the blade from BEM, and following the
procedure of VLAD, axial and tangential velocities are imposed at the
interface. BEM method is verified against the
experimental results [Veldhuis, 2005] and
found to be performing well.
