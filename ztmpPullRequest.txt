The present work is on modifications to the actuator disk model.  Variable load actuator disk (VLAD) [Saetta, 2020] uses the given blade loading (which is fixed for the entire duration of the simulation) to impose axial and tangential jumps at the interface.

Propeller loading depends on many different parameters and is affected by the surrounding structures and angle of attack (AoA).  A method that updates the blade loading at run time is required to take care of the interactions and installation effects. 

In the present approach, the Blade Element Method (BEM)  is used to calculate the pressure jump and swirl distribtions across the propeller disc and is coupled to the SU2 solver.  The blade loading and changes to the flow-field are calculated recursively. Propeller geometry details, airfoil characteristics, propeller speed and set blade angle are required as inputs.  Using the thrust and power along the blade from BEM, and following the procedure of VLAD, axial and tangential velocities are imposed at the interface. BEM method is verified against the experimental results [Veldhuis, 2005] and found to be performing well.
